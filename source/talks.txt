+ On girth and the parameterized complexity of token sliding and token jumping, by Amer E. Mouawad, at Parameterized Complexity Seminar (2020-12-08)

* **Corresponding Paper:** Valentin Bartier, Nicolas Bousquet, Clément Dallard, Kyle Lomer, and Amer E. Mouawad. [[a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ISAAC.2020.44"]]On girth and the parameterized complexity of token sliding and token jumping[[/a]], Proceedings of ISAAC 2020, LIPIcs 181, pp. 44:1-44:17. (Preprint: [[a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01673"]]arXiv:2007.01673[[/a]]).
* **Abstract:** In the token jumping problem we are given a graph [[$G$]] and two independent sets [[$S$]] and [[$T$]] of [[$G$]], each of size [[$k > 0$]]. If we view each independent set as a collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of [[$G$]], then the token jumping problem asks for a sequence of independent sets which transforms [[$S$]] to [[$T$]] by individual token jumps which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph classes, e.g., planar bounded-degree graphs and graphs of bounded pathwidth. A closely related problem is the token sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump to any vertex of the graph we require that a token slides along an edge of the graph. Token sliding is also known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph classes. In this talk, we investigate the parameterized complexity of both problems on several graph classes, focusing on the effect of excluding certain cycles from the input graph. _

+ Reconfiguration of Spanning Trees with Many or Few Leaves, by Nicolas Bousquet, at ESA 2020 (2020-08-29)

* **Corresponding Paper:** Nicolas Bousquet, Takehiro Ito, Yusuke Kobayashi, Haruka Mizuta, Paul Ouvrard, Akira Suzuki, and Kunihiro Wasa. [[a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2020.24"]]Reconfiguration of Spanning Trees with Many or Few Leaves[[/a]], Proceedings of ESA 2020, LIPIcs 173, pp. 24:1-24:15. (Preprint: [[a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14309"]]arXiv:2006.14309[[/a]]).
* **Abstract:** Let [[$G$]] be a graph and [[$T_1, T_2$]] be two spanning trees of [[$G$]]. We say that [[$T_1$]] can be transformed into [[$T_2$]] via an edge flip if there exist two edges [[$e \in T_1$]] and [[$f$]] in [[$T_2$]] such that [[$T_2 = (T_1 \setminus e) \cup f$]]. Since spanning trees form a matroid, one can indeed transform a spanning tree into any other via a sequence of edge flips, as observed in [Takehiro Ito et al., 2011]. We investigate the problem of determining, given two spanning trees [[$T_1, T_2$]] with an additional property [[$\Pi$]], if there exists an edge flip transformation from [[$T_1$]] to [[$T_2$]] keeping property [[$\Pi$]] all along. First we show that determining if there exists a transformation from [[$T_1$]] to [[$T_2$]] such that all the trees of the sequence have at most [[$k$]] (for any fixed [[$k \geq 3$]]) leaves is PSPACE-complete. We then prove that determining if there exists a transformation from [[$T_1$]] to [[$T_2$]] such that all the trees of the sequence have at least [[$k$]] leaves (where [[$k$]] is part of the input) is PSPACE-complete even restricted to split, bipartite or planar graphs. We complete this result by showing that the problem becomes polynomial for cographs, interval graphs and when [[$k = n-2$]].

+ Reconfiguring sliding squares in-place by flooding, by Joel Moreno, at EuroCG 2020 (2020-03-17)

* **Abstract:** We present a new algorithm that reconfigures between any two edge-connected configurations of [[$n$]] sliding squares within their bounding boxes. The algorithm achieves the reconfiguration by means of [[$\Theta(n^2)$]] slide moves. A visual simulator and a set of experiments allows us to compare the performance over different shapes, showing that in many practical cases the number of slide moves grows significantly slower than in others as [[$n$]] increases.

+ Approximating Shortest Connected Graph Transformation for Trees, by Alice Joffard, at SOFSEM 2020 (2020-01-21)

Here, we provide the corresponding paper, abstract, and links to the slides and recorded video of the talk.

* **Corresponding Paper:** Nicolas Bousquet and Alice Joffard. [[a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38919-2_7"]]Approximating Shortest Connected Graph Transformation for Trees[[/a]], Proceedings of SOFSEM 2020, LNCS 12011, pp. 76-87. (Preprint: [[a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02358489/"]]hal-02358489[[/a]]).
* **Abstract:** Let [[$G$]], [[$H$]] be two connected graphs with the same degree sequence. The aim of this paper is to find a transformation from [[$G$]] to [[$H$]] via a sequence of flips maintaining connectivity. A flip of [[$G$]] is an operation consisting in replacing two existing edges [[$uv$]], [[$xy$]] of [[$G$]] by [[$ux$]] and [[$vy$]]. _
Taylor showed that there always exists a sequence of flips that transforms [[$G$]] into [[$H$]] maintaining connectivity. Bousquet and Mary proved that there exists a [[$4$]]-approximation algorithm of a shortest transformation. In this paper, we show that there exists a [[$2.5$]]-approximation algorithm running in polynomial time. We also discuss the tightness of the lower bound and show that, in order to drastically improve the approximation ratio, we need to improve the best known lower bounds.

+ Distributed Reconfiguration of Graph Problems, by Mikael Rabie, at Seminat in Laboratory of Information, Networking and Communication Sciences, Paris, France (2019-09-25)

* **Corresponding Paper:** Marthe Bonamy, Paul Ouvrard, Mikaël Rabie, Jukka Suomela and Jara Uitto. [[a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2018.12"]]Distributed Recoloring[[/a]], Proceedings of DISC 2018, LIPIcs 121, pp. 12:1-12:17. (Preprint: [[a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06742"]]arXiv:1802.06742[[/a]]).
* **Abstract:** In Graph Theory, a reconfiguration problem is as following: given two solutions of a problem and a transition definition, is there a path of acceptable solutions from the first to the second using a transition one after another? What is the length of the shortest reconfiguration path? What complexities are involved? For example, a recoloration problem asks if we can go from a coloration to another, by changing the color of a node at each transition (with the coloring still valid in the intermediate steps). In this talk, the goal would be to consider distributed version of two reconfiguration problems: recoloring, and reconfiguring independent sets. To parallelise the process, we will accept to change the state of different nodes at once, under certain hypothesis (for example, we will recolor an independent set of nodes). The questions will be, using the LOCAL model, how much communication is needed (i.e. how much a node needs knowledge of its neighborhood) in order to produce a reconfiguration schedule of a given length. For the distributed recoloring (DISC 2019), we prove that the addition of colors for the intermediate steps is needed for some cases in order to have a solution. I will provide the analysis of trees, where we want to go from a 3-coloring to another with the use of a 4th color. II will show that a constant schedule can be found after [[$O(D+\log^* n)$]] communications. For the reconfiguration of independent sets (ICALP 2019 Best Paper), we will present different transitions from the centralized settings, to then justify the one we use. We prove that a constant schedule can be found after [[$O(D+\log^* n)$]] communications, and a linear schedule can be found after a constant number of communications. _
Those works are the result of collaborations with Marthe Bonamy, Keren Censor-Hillel, Paul Ouvrard, Jara Uitto and Jukka Suomela.

* **Abstract:** For problems with a discrete set of solutions, a reconfiguration problem defines solutions to be adjacent if they meet some condition of closeness, and then asks for two given solutions it there is a path between them in the set of all solutions. The reconfiguration problem for graph homomorphisms has seen fair activity in recent years. Fixing a template, the problem [[$Recol(H)$]] for a graph [[$H$]] asks if one can get from one [[$H$]]-colouring of a graph [[$G$]] to another by changing one vertex at a time, always remaining an [[$H$]]-colouring. If the changed vertex has a loop, it must move to an adjecent vertex. Depending on [[$H$]], the problem seems to be either polynomial time solvable or PSPACE-complete. We discuss many recent results in the area and work towards conjecturing for which the problem is PSPACE-complete. _

+ Reconfiguration of Triangulations of a Planar Point Set, by Anna Lubiw, at PIMS-UManitoba Distinguished Lecture (2018-02-15)

For more information, see [http://www.mathtube.org/lecture/video/reconfiguration-triangulations-planar-point-set this page].
Here, we provide a copy of the abstract of the talk and the link to the recorded video.

* **Abstract:** In a reconfiguration problem, the goal is to change an initial configuration of some structure to a final configuration using some limited set of moves. Examples include: sorting a list by swapping pairs of adjacent elements; finding the edit distance between two strings; or solving a Rubik’s cube in a minimum number of moves. Central questions are: Is reconfiguration possible? How many moves are required? In this talk I will survey some reconfiguration problems, and then discuss the case of triangulations of a point set in the plane. A move in this case is a flip that replaces one edge by the opposite edge of its surrounding quadrilateral when that quadrilateral is convex. In joint work with Zuzana Masárová and Uli Wagner we characterize when one edge-labelled triangulation can be reconfigured to another via flips. The proof involves combinatorics, geometry, and topology.

+ Reconfiguration of Common Independent Sets of Matroids, by Moritz Mühlenthaler, at Aussois C.O.W. 2018 (2018-01-11)

The talk was presented by [https://www12.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/people/muehlenthaler/ Moritz Mühlenthaler] at [http://www.iasi.cnr.it/aussois/web/home/program/year/2018 Aussois C.O.W. 2018].
Here, we provide the abstract and link to the presentation slides.

* **Abstract:** We consider solution graphs of combinatorial problems that arise from certain natural adjacency relations on the solution sets. Such graphs are typically too large to be stored explicitly. After a brief overview of what is known about the complexity of the st-reachability problem on such graphs, our focus will be solution graphs that can be characterized in terms of common independent sets of matroids. We will showcase the following recent dichotomy result: For common independent sets of at most two matroids, the corresponding st-reachability problem can be solved in polynomial time, while for three or more matroids the problem is PSPACE-complete.

+ Introduction to Reconfiguration, by Naomi Nishimura, at CanaDAM 2017's Mini-symposia on Reconfiguration (2017-06-14)

[[ul]]
[[li]]
**Abstract:** Reconfiguration is concerned with relationships among solutions to a problem instance, where the reconfigration of one solution to another is a sequence of steps such that each step produces an intermediate feasible solution. The solution space can be represented as a graph, where vertices representing two solutions are adjacent if one can be formed from the other in a single step. Work in the area encompasses both structural questions (Is the reconfiguration graph connected?) and algorithmic ones (How can one find the shortest sequence of steps between two solutions?) This talk introduces techniques, results, and future directions in the area.

**Corresponding Paper:** Marthe Bonamy and Nicolas Bousquet. [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68705-6_10 Token Sliding on Chordal Graphs], Proceedings of WG 2017, LNCS 10520, pp. 127-139. (Preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00442 arXiv:1605.00442]).


[[/li]][[li]]
**Abstract:** Let [[$I$]] be an independent set of a graph [[$G$]]. Imagine that a token is located on any vertex of [[$I$]]. We can now move the tokens of [[$I$]] along the edges of the graph as long as the set of tokens still defines an independent set of [[$G$]]. Given two independent sets [[$I$]] and [[$J$]], the Token Sliding problem consists in deciding whether there exists a sequence of independent sets which transforms [[$I$]] into [[$J$]] so that every pair of consecutive independent sets of the sequence can be obtained via a token move. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete even on planar graphs. Demaine et al. [ISAAC'14] asked whether the Token Sliding reconfiguration problem is polynomial time solvable on interval graphs and more generally in chordal graphs. Yamada and Uehara [WALCOM'16] showed that a polynomial time transformation can be found in proper interval graphs. We answer the first question of Demaine et al. and generalize the result of Yamada and Uehara by showing that we can decide in polynomial time whether two independent sets of an interval graph are in the same connected component. Moreover, we answer similar questions by showing that: (i) determining if there exists a token sliding transformation between every pair of [[$k$]]-independent sets in an interval graph can be decided in polynomial time; (ii) deciding this problem becomes co-NP-hard and even co-W[2]-hard (parameterized by the size of the independent set) on split graphs, a sub-class of chordal graphs.

**Abstract:** Reconfiguration problems arise when we wish to find a step-by-step transformation between two feasible solutions of a combinatorial problem such that all intermediate results are also feasible. They are PSPACE-complete for most underlying NP-complete problems, and in P for several polynomial-time solvable underlying problems, although there are exceptions to both general patterns. In this talk, I will give a broad introduction and invite you to this exciting new area.
